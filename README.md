# XRPL-Concept
A proof of concept using XRPL

This repo contains a flask app that will allow users to register accounts with wallets generated on the test net. Users create posts with issued value for all others to see. The beta branch is was trying to implement a more practical implementation of transactions, but I have not figured out how to handle the wallets correctly in the app.
